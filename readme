For my rebuild assignment I chose to do Cairncross.com.  This is the website of the company I work for currently.  Our marketing department went with a webdesigner named Gage.  Often he delivers what we need but is always very hesitant to help further.  The marketing loves him, but our IT department is a bit hesitant.  I would like to see how good of a div-veloper he is.
changing so that git register a change.
